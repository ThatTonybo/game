A police station simulation/magagement game, made in Python 3.6 with pyglet. But it looks pretty bare, doesn't it? Read on.

## So, what's happening here?
My plans for this game went further than my basic knowledge did, and now I have a spreadsheet full of ideas and full features described, but with no way to use or build any of them into a functioning script, let alone a 2.5D game world. And with the approaching technology of RTX and multiple games coming up, I feel as if this game has no purpose, even though I spent countless hours on designing and writing about every single part.

So, my ideas and all have come to one point, either I spend every drop of free time I have on learning and trying to make it, which will take upwards of a year, even as far as three or more, or I scrap it all. It's a tough decision to abandon all your work.

## All these ideas?
I've been constantly planning, daydreaming, thinking and developing ideas that range from full callout systems to staff management and zoning, random events, research, and a whole lot more. If you'd like access to the game documentation so far, which has full information on all ideas and game features, feel free to get in touch via [Discord](https://discord.gg/nnpPGRy), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thattonybo) or if you have nothing else, [email me](mailto:thattonybo@gmail.com).

## Will there be any possibility this stays a thing?
Maybe, maybe not. I'm 100% sure this won't be completed within a year or two, and not without any help from other developers and contributors. The future of the project is undetermined right now, but I hope in the end it'll become a playable game eventually.

## TL;DR
- This game is really cool personally, but without help it's going to be scrapped.
- The full project planning can be accessed by contacting me.

Thanks for reading if you're interested in the game at all. Feel free to contact me over any questions, offers, or just to say hi.
