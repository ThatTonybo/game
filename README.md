A police station simulation/magagement game, made in Python 3.6 with pyglet.

## So, what's happening here?
My plans for this game went further than my basic knowledge did, and now I have a spreadsheet full of ideas and full features described, but with no way to use or build any of them into a functioning script, let alone a 2.5D game world. And with the approaching technology of RTX and multiple games coming up, I feel as if this game has no purpose, even though I spent countless hours on designing and writing about every single part.

So, my ideas and all have come to one point, either I spend every drop of free time I have on learning and trying to make it, which will take upwards of a year, even as far as three or more, or I scrap it all. It's a tough decision to abandon all your work.
